    <h4>Method</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the kettle for the pasta</li>
            <li>Heat Pan to a a hot heat to cook the mince within 2-3 minutes without destroying the flavour</li>
            <li>Season a reasonable amount of salt and pepper, remember it will lose a lot of flavour whilst cooking fast</li>
            <li>After 2/3 of each piece of mince looks cooked then put your sauce in</li>
            <li>Turn the heat down to a low/medium temperature and slowly stir it</li>
            <li>Whilst thats cooking put your boiled water into the pan and put a handful of salt into the pan</li>
            <li>Once your pasta has cooked for 8 minutes or so in hot boiling water it should be fully cooked, It will continue to cook when out of the pan</li>
            <li>Let it cool down a little then put on some olive oil to keep it from sticking together</li>
            <li>And now serve the pasta on a plate and the bolognese on top.</li>
        </ol>
